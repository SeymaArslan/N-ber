N'ber or N-ber is a Swift project, the project is similar to whatsapp or telegram app.

## Installation


## Notes

Save messages to Firebase, because a realm messages save and there is no error, even though visiually we couldn't identify it. But we are going to assume that the message is there (OutgoingMessage.swift -> sendMessage method). We will check it once we start reading from realm database. But now I want to save also our messages to the firebase.
